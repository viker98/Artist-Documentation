# How to create a perforce Workspace

### Workspaces Information
* Workspaces are local versions of the Depot that are used to download the files that are uploaded to the server and when done working uploading the files in your workspace to the depot. **For a tutorial on how to upload your work go [here](UploadWork.md)**

#
1. After logging in (if you need help doing that [here](PerforceLogin.md)) you should see this screen and you will need to click the ``Workspace`` button which is marked below. **Note if their is already a workspace their you can just click is still**

2. When clicked it should provide a drop down that looks like the image below. If you have workspaces they should be there and if you need one that is already created click it. However if you are creating a new one click ``New Workspace``

3. This menu should pop up and to make sure you only get what you want click the button that is in a box on the image below.

4. If their is anything in the text box like what I have in the image below you should **DELETE** all of the text till their is nothing left in the box and then go back to the other menu by clicking the button next to the button that got you to this screen If their was nothing in the box then just keep going forward in the tutorial.

5. Now that you are here and their isnt any residule depots being added you want to find the depot that you are going to use for this example im using light chasers you will **RIGHT CLICK** the depot that you want to use and then click ``Include Tree`` then you wanna just press the ``ok`` button on the botton right. **NOTE if you wanna move the workspace directory to a place that is easy to save to and find like the desktop you need to go to the top where is says ``Workspace root`` and click ``Browse`` then you will select a folder to put the root in.**

6. You will end up back at the main menu and you need to click the workspace button next to the Depot button and you should see a folder with nothing in it. Click the folder and the ``Get Latests`` button at the top should light up and be clickable. You then click the button to get the lastest verson of the depot. **NOTE its always a good practice to always get the lastest before working so that you arnt working on a old verson of the depot saved to your computer**
